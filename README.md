# PesetaCoin-icon
Let's build a new icon for PTC

## Methodology
* Checked all the top 200 icons to see what are the common rules: simplicity, should work in any sizes, in very small sizes
* Logos can be on top of a background shape or not, it doesn't really matter, we can always adapt and try new shapes
* Logos are made in Black & white, the colors will be added later, on the one you choose
* I mainly focused on the letter P and in some of them I somehow added in a hidden way t and c
